= About

Dynamic containerized SSH server provisioning.


= Usage

  PUB ssh.(sshark server id).start
      
    Provisions a SSH session on the given sshark server.

    `sshark server id` is the unique identifier for the target server.

    Payload: {"session":"(session id)","public_key":"(public key)"}

      `session id` is a unique identifier for the session.
      `public key` is the key to authorize access to the SSH server.

  --------------------------------------------------

  PUB ssh.stop

    Terminate a SSH session. This destroys the container, shutting down the
    SSH server and kicking everyone off.

    Payload: {"session":"(session id)"}

      `session id` is a unique identifier for the session.

  --------------------------------------------------

  SUB ssh.advertise
    
    Broadcasts the existence of a sshark server to other components in the
    system. Will eventually include available memory/disk, to enable balanced
    placement algorithms.

    Sent periodically.

    Payload: {"id":"(sshark server id)"}
      `sshark server id` is a unique identifier for the sshark server.

  --------------------------------------------------

  SUB ssh.shutdown

    Broadcasts that the sshark server is going to shut down, so that other
    components may stop directing start requests at it.

    Payload: {"id":"(sshark server id)"}
      `sshark server id` is a unique identifier for the sshark server.
